#### Option 3: Unsplash (For stock photos)
1. Go to [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com)
2. Search for relevant images
3. Click on an image and copy its URL
4. Paste this URL in the "Image URL" field

### Step 4: Preview and Submit
1. As you type the image URL, you'll see a preview of the image
2. Review all your information
3. Click **"Add Blog Post"** to publish

### Step 5: View Your Post
1. After submitting, you'll see a success message
2. Go back to the blog page to see your new post
3. Featured posts will appear at the top, regular posts below

### Step 6: Managing Posts (Delete if Needed)
1. **In Admin Panel**: Hover over any post in the "Recent Posts" section to see a red delete button
2. **On Blog Page**: Hover over any post to see a small red trash icon
3. Click the delete button and confirm to remove the post
4. **Note**: Deletion cannot be undone, so be careful!

## Tips for Great Blog Posts

### Writing Content:
- Keep titles clear and engaging
- Write in a conversational tone
- Include relevant keywords for SEO
- Break up text with bullet points or short paragraphs
- Aim for 200-500 words for good readability

### Choosing Images:
- Use high-quality images (at least 800px wide)
- Choose images that relate to your content
- Ensure images are properly licensed for use
- Consider using your own photos when possible

### Tags and Categories:
- Use 3-5 relevant tags per post
- Popular tags: Sustainability, Innovation, 3DPrinting, Education, Technology, CircularEconomy
- Choose the most appropriate category for your post

### Featured Posts:
- Use sparingly - only for your most important content
- Featured posts appear prominently at the top of the blog
- Good for announcements, major updates, or key insights

## Troubleshooting

### If your post doesn't appear:
1. Check that all required fields are filled (Title and Content)
2. Refresh the blog page
3. Check the browser console for any error messages

### If the image doesn't show:
1. Make sure the image URL is a direct link to the image file
2. The URL should end with .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.
3. Try a different image hosting service

### If you need to edit or delete a post:
- **Delete**: You can delete posts by clicking the red trash icon that appears when you hover over any post (both in the admin panel and on the blog page)
- **Edit**: Currently, you'll need to contact the web developer to edit existing posts. This feature may be added in the future.
