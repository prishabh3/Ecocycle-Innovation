## Troubleshooting

### If your post doesn't appear:
1. Check that all required fields are filled (Title and Content)
2. Refresh the blog page
3. Check the browser console for any error messages

### If the image doesn't show:
1. **For file uploads**: Make sure the file is under 5MB and is a valid image format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
2. **For URLs**: Make sure the image URL is a direct link to the image file
3. **For URLs**: The URL should end with .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.
4. **For URLs**: Try a different image hosting service
5. **General**: Check the browser console for any error messages

### If you need to edit or delete a post:
- **Delete**: You can delete posts by clicking the red trash icon that appears when you hover over any post (both in the admin panel and on the blog page)
- **Edit**: Currently, you'll need to contact the web developer to edit existing posts. This feature may be added in the future.
